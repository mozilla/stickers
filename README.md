# Very Unofficial, Completely Unauthorized Sticker Collection

Mozilla has a long history of employee designed and shared stickers. If there's a gathering, there's probably going to be a few stickers traded around.

This repo is a collection of sharable files for folk who want to see, print, reuse, remix, or whatever.

We ask that you be respectful of the original art, that you do not sell these images or works derived from these images, or use them, in whole or in part, of any commercial work.

## Printing

These images are best printed as 300x300 dpi (dots per inch). If using a printing service, like [Sticker Robot](https://stickerobot.com/), be sure that the art properly fits the guidelines by using [an appropriate template](https://stickerobot.com/help/sticker-templates/).

## Submissions

If you would like to include your sticker art here, please submit a Pull Request (PR).

Sticker art should:

* Be something you'd show your Mom / Boss / Mitchell.
* Be 300 dpi or Scaled Vector Graphic (.svg) format.
* Use rasterized or vectored fonts (convert fonts to object lines)
* Avoid using branded or trademarked images or content (e.g. avoid using Disney or Nintendo intellectual property.)
